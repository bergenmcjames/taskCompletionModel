##Load packages.
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
install.packages('sandwich')
library(sandwich)
install.packages('emmeans')
library(emmeans)
library(dplyr)

##Read the data in.
npp <- read.csv('https://www.dropbox.com/s/id0iv5cxyns9fxt/nuclear_power_plant.csv?dl=1')

##Prepare for regression modeling.
npp$Nationality <- factor(npp$Nationality)
npp$Nationality <- relevel(npp$Nationality, ref = "non-US")

##Finding summary statistics for write-up.
npp %>%
  group_by(Nationality) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_time = mean(Time),
    sd_time = sd(Time),
    n = n()
  )

##Creating a summary statistics vector for TACOM.
c(
  mean = mean(npp$TACOM),
  sd = sd(npp$TACOM),
  min = min(npp$TACOM),
  max = max(npp$TACOM)
)

##Creating various mlr models.
m1 <- lm(Time ~ TACOM + Nationality, data = npp)

m2 <- lm(Time ~ TACOM * Nationality, data = npp)

m3 <- lm(Time ~ TACOM + I(TACOM^2) + Nationality, data = npp)

m4 <- lm(Time ~ (TACOM + I(TACOM^2)) * Nationality, data = npp)

##Running AIC and BIC tests on our mlrs.
AIC(m1, m2, m3, m4)
BIC(m1, m2, m3, m4)

##running an ANOVA test to find the variance for each variable on our selected model, getting summary statistics.
anova(m4)
summary(m4)

##Getting TACOM quantiles.
q <- quantile(npp$TACOM, c(0.25, 0.75))
q

##Computing adjusted means and finding the difference by Nationality at different TACOM levels.
emm <- emmeans(m4, ~ Nationality | TACOM,
               at = list(TACOM = q))
contrast(emm, method = "pairwise")

##Graphing our chosen model.
ggplot(npp, aes(x = TACOM, y = Time, color = Nationality)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ poly(x, 2),
              se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Task Completion Time vs Task Complexity",
    x = "Task Complexity (TACOM)",
    y = "Completion Time (seconds)"
  )

##Getting diagnostic plots for our model.
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(m4)
